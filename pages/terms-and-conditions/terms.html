        Please read the Terms of Service carefully before You start to use the Services. By using the Services or by
        clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to You, You accept
        and

        The
        Services are offered and available only to users who are 18 years of age or older.
        By using the Services, You represent and warrant that You are of legal age to form a binding contract with
        Dolia

        eligibility
        requirements. If You do not meet all of these requirements, You must not access or use the Services.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Updates to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are
        effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter.
        However,
        any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to
        any
        disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted on the Website. Your
        continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that You accept and
        agree
        to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so You are aware of any changes, as
        they
        are binding on You.</p>
    <h2>3. Accessing the Services; Account Registration and Security</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to introduce, withdraw or amend websites, or any content, material, product offering or
        other Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We make no guarantee that the Services will be
        available
        at any time, and we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at
        any
        time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or the
        entire
        Services, to users, including registered users. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary
        for
        You to have access to the Services. To access the Services or some of Dolia Cats’ Purchaser-only resources,
        You
        may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of Your use of
        the
        Services that all the information You provide to access the Services is correct, current, and complete. You
        agree that all information You provide to register for these Services or otherwise, including, but not
        limited
        to, through the use of any Purchaser-only features, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and You consent to
        all
        actions we take with respect to Your information consistent with our Privacy Policy. If You choose, or are
        provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures,
        You
        must treat such information as confidential, and You must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You
        also acknowledge that Your account is personal to You and agree not to provide any other person with access
        to
        the Services or portions of them using Your user name, password, or other security information — not even to
        another person associated with Your business. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access
        to
        or use of Your user name or password or any other breach of security. If You are using a public or shared
        computer, You also agree to ensure that You exit from Your account at the end of each session. You should
        use
        particular caution when accessing Your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able
        to
        view or record Your password or other personal information. We have the right to disable any user name,
        password, or other identifier, whether chosen by You or provided by us, at any time if, in our opinion, You
        have
        violated any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER — IMPORTANT — PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
        18.1 ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
        YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN
        THEIR
        CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
        US,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR
        RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE JAMS, INC.
        (“JAMS”) RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY
        JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WE OR YOU MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR
        FEDERAL
        COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO GRANT IT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT OR
        MISAPPROPRIATION
        OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED
        THAN
        IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
        18.2 Small Claims Court; Class Action Waiver
        As an alternative, You may bring Your claim in Your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small
        claims court’s rules and if such claim is within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is
        transferred,
        removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf. Neither You nor we
        will
        participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. YOU ARE
        GIVING
        UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE
        AGAINST
        US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL
        ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or
        representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the
        proceeding.
        18.3 Procedures
        These dispute resolution provisions will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law
        concerning arbitration. In the event that JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one
        hundred
        and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or You can elect to have the arbitration
        administered
        instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
        entered
        in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator
        will
        not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree
        that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related
        to

        claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.

        Service

        at the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. If You do not notify us in accordance with this
        paragraph, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Disputes section, including, without limitation, the
        arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and further including such provisions in any revisions we
        make
        to these Terms of Service after the date of Your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) Your
        name; (ii) Your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that You do not wish to resolve
        disputes with us through arbitration or waive Your ability to participate in a class action. If we make any
        changes to this Disputes section (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices or
        rejections of future changes to this Disputes section), You may reject any such change by sending us written
        notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service.
        It
        is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if You had properly
        opted
        out within the first thirty (30) days after You first accepted the provisions in this Disputes section. If
        You
        have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any
        dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified by any changes You
        did
        not reject. A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; if You
        previously entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such
        agreements in the future, Your notification that You are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes
        section
        shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between You and us.
        18.5 Severability
        If any of the prohibitions against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties
        contained
        above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Disputes section will be null
        and
        void. This Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement and class action
        waivers
        contained herein, will survive the termination of Your relationship with us.

        to
        the ERC-721 standard. “Own” means, with respect to an NFT, an NFT that You have purchased or otherwise
        rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant
        blockchain. “Ownership” means the legal status of a person or entity that Owns a Purchased NFT. “Extensions”
        means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as extensions of or overlays to the Art, (ii) do
        not
        modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.
        “Purchased
        NFT” means an NFT that You Own. “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without
        limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any
        other

        9.2. Ownership.
        You acknowledge and agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all worldwide legal right,
        title
        and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that You have in
        and to
        the Art are limited to those described in this License. Creator reserves all rights in and to the Art not
        expressly granted to You in this License.
        9.3. License.
        a. General Use. Subject to and conditioned upon Your continued compliance with the terms of this License,
        Creator grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art
        associated
        with Your Purchased NFTs, along with any Extensions that You choose to create or use, solely for the
        following
        purposes: (i) for Your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the
        purchase
        and sale of Your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to
        display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the
        Art;
        or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
        participation of Your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT
        owner’s
        rights to display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can
        display
        the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the
        website/application. b. Commercial Use. Subject to and conditioned upon Your continued compliance with the
        terms

        Art associated with Your Purchased NFTs for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art and
        commercializing Your own merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art associated with Your
        Purchased NFTs or derivative works of such Art (“Commercial Use”). For the sake of clarity, nothing in this
        Section 9.3(b) will be deemed to restrict You from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the
        use
        and sale of NFTs generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights
        to
        display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the
        Art;
        (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
        participation of NFTs generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically
        verifies
        each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the
        actual
        owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased
        NFT
        leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing. c. Transferability and
        Sublicensing. The License granted hereunder is not assignable or transferable except in connection with Your
        sale of the Purchased NFT, and You acknowledge and agree that upon such sale the License shall be
        transferred by
        operation of law and the terms of this License to the person or entity to whom You convey Ownership of the
        Purchased NFT. While You Own the Purchased NFT, You may sublicense Your rights under this License to third
        parties, but only on condition that (i) You provide written notice of all such sublicenses to the new Owner
        of
        the Purchased NFT following any change in Ownership of the Purchased NFT, and (ii) such sublicenses shall be
        terminable by the new Owner. Following termination of a sublicense, physical embodiments of the Art lawfully
        made under such sublicenses, such as merchandise in inventory, may continue to be distributed as provided
        under
        the U.S. Copyright Act.
        9.4. Restrictions.
        You agree not to use the Art associated with Your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other
        forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be
        found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.
        9.5. Terms of License.
        The License granted in Section 9.3 above applies only to the extent that You continue to Own the applicable
        Purchased NFT. If at any time You sell, trade, donate, give away, or otherwise transfer Ownership of Your
        Purchased NFT for any reason, the License granted in Section 9.3 will immediately be transferred to the new
        Owner with respect to that NFT as set forth above in Section 9.3(c) without the requirement of notice, and
        You
        will have no further rights in or to the Art associated with that NFT. If You exceed the scope of the
        license
        grant in Section 9.3(b) without entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption
        from
        Creator, You acknowledge and agree that: (i) You are in breach of this License; (ii) in addition to any
        remedies
        that may be available to Creator at law or in equity, the Creator may immediately terminate this License,
        without the requirement of notice; and (iii) You will be responsible to reimburse Creator for any costs and
        expenses incurred by Creator during the course of enforcing the terms of this License against You.
