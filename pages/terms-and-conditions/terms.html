        The

    <h2>2. Updates to the Terms</h2>

    <p>We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are

        effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter.

        However,

        any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to

        any

        disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted on the Website. Your

        continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that You accept and

        agree

        they

        are binding on You.</p>

    <h2>3. Accessing the Services; Account Registration and Security</h2>

    <p>We reserve the right to introduce, withdraw or amend websites, or any content, material, product offering or

        other Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We make no guarantee that the Services will be

        available

        at any time, and we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at

        any

        time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or the

        entire

        Services, to users, including registered users. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary

        for

        You to have access to the Services. To access the Services or some of Dolia Cats’ Purchaser-only resources,

        You

        may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of Your use of

        the

        Services that all the information You provide to access the Services is correct, current, and complete. You

        agree that all information You provide to register for these Services or otherwise, including, but not

        limited

        to, through the use of any Purchaser-only features, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and You consent to

        all

        actions we take with respect to Your information consistent with our Privacy Policy. If You choose, or are

        provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures,

        You

        must treat such information as confidential, and You must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You

        also acknowledge that Your account is personal to You and agree not to provide any other person with access

        to

        the Services or portions of them using Your user name, password, or other security information — not even to

        another person associated with Your business. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access

        to

        or use of Your user name or password or any other breach of security. If You are using a public or shared

        computer, You also agree to ensure that You exit from Your account at the end of each session. You should

        use

        particular caution when accessing Your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able

        to

        view or record Your password or other personal information. We have the right to disable any user name,

        password, or other identifier, whether chosen by You or provided by us, at any time if, in our opinion, You

        have

        violated any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>

        18.1 ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY

        YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN

        THEIR

        CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

        US,

        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR

        RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE JAMS, INC.

        (“JAMS”) RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY

        JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WE OR YOU MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR

        FEDERAL

        COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO GRANT IT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT OR

        MISAPPROPRIATION

        OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED

        THAN

        IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

        18.2 Small Claims Court; Class Action Waiver

        As an alternative, You may bring Your claim in Your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small

        claims court’s rules and if such claim is within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is

        transferred,

        removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf. Neither You nor we

        will

        participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. YOU ARE

        GIVING

        UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE

        ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or

        representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the

        proceeding.

        18.3 Procedures

        These dispute resolution provisions will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law

        concerning arbitration. In the event that JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one

        hundred

        and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or You can elect to have the arbitration

        administered

        instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be

        entered

        in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator

        will

        not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree

        arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and further including such provisions in any revisions we

        make

        to these Terms of Service after the date of Your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) Your

        name; (ii) Your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that You do not wish to resolve

        rejections of future changes to this Disputes section), You may reject any such change by sending us written

        notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service.

        It

        is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if You had properly

        opted

        out within the first thirty (30) days after You first accepted the provisions in this Disputes section. If

        You

        have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any

        dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified by any changes You

        did

        not reject. A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; if You

        previously entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such

        agreements in the future, Your notification that You are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes

        section

        shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between You and us.

        18.5 Severability

        If any of the prohibitions against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties

        contained

        above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Disputes section will be null

        and

        void. This Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement and class action

        contained herein, will survive the termination of Your relationship with us.

        not

        modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.

        “Purchased

        NFT” means an NFT that You Own. “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without

        limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any

        9.2. Ownership.

        You acknowledge and agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all worldwide legal right,

        title

        and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that You have in

        and to

        the Art are limited to those described in this License. Creator reserves all rights in and to the Art not

        expressly granted to You in this License.

        9.3. License.

        a. General Use. Subject to and conditioned upon Your continued compliance with the terms of this License,

        Creator grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art

        with Your Purchased NFTs, along with any Extensions that You choose to create or use, solely for the

        following

        purposes: (i) for Your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the

        purchase

        and sale of Your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to

        display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the

        Art;

        or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or

        participation of Your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT

        rights to display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can

        display

        the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the

        commercializing Your own merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art associated with Your

        Purchased NFTs or derivative works of such Art (“Commercial Use”). For the sake of clarity, nothing in this

        Section 9.3(b) will be deemed to restrict You from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the

        use

        and sale of NFTs generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights

        to

        display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the

        Art;

        (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or

        participation of NFTs generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically

        verifies

        each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the

        actual

        owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased

        NFT

        leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing. c. Transferability and

        Sublicensing. The License granted hereunder is not assignable or transferable except in connection with Your

        sale of the Purchased NFT, and You acknowledge and agree that upon such sale the License shall be

        transferred by

        operation of law and the terms of this License to the person or entity to whom You convey Ownership of the

        Purchased NFT. While You Own the Purchased NFT, You may sublicense Your rights under this License to third

        parties, but only on condition that (i) You provide written notice of all such sublicenses to the new Owner

        of

        the Purchased NFT following any change in Ownership of the Purchased NFT, and (ii) such sublicenses shall be

        terminable by the new Owner. Following termination of a sublicense, physical embodiments of the Art lawfully

        made under such sublicenses, such as merchandise in inventory, may continue to be distributed as provided

        under

        the U.S. Copyright Act.

        9.4. Restrictions.

        You agree not to use the Art associated with Your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other

        forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be

        found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.

        9.5. Terms of License.

        The License granted in Section 9.3 above applies only to the extent that You continue to Own the applicable

        Purchased NFT. If at any time You sell, trade, donate, give away, or otherwise transfer Ownership of Your

        Purchased NFT for any reason, the License granted in Section 9.3 will immediately be transferred to the new

        Owner with respect to that NFT as set forth above in Section 9.3(c) without the requirement of notice, and

        You

        will have no further rights in or to the Art associated with that NFT. If You exceed the scope of the

        license

        grant in Section 9.3(b) without entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption

        from

        Creator, You acknowledge and agree that: (i) You are in breach of this License; (ii) in addition to any

        remedies

        that may be available to Creator at law or in equity, the Creator may immediately terminate this License,

        without the requirement of notice; and (iii) You will be responsible to reimburse Creator for any costs and

        expenses incurred by Creator during the course of enforcing the terms of this License against You.
